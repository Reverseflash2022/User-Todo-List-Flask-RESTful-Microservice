# User-Todo-List-Flask-RESTful-Microservice
This project aims to develop a production-ready, robust, and comprehensive RESTful microservice for managing a user's to-do list, providing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. The microservice is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework, and MySQL for persistent data storage.
